    "\n",
    "The SDC authors however used a different formulation, namely the **Node-to-Node formulation (N2N)**, which describes the node update from one node to the next. While both formulations can produce identical SDC schemes, they have some fundamental differences from an implementation perspective, and leads to different generalizations of SDC.\n",
