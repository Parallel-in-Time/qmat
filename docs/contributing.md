# Contributing

ðŸ“œ _Package is currently developed with an open-source philosophy, so any contribution is welcome_

## General rules

Ideally, your code implementation should be :

- _**simple** enough so your grandma can understand it_
- _**beautiful** enough to make your cousin in art school want to read it_
- _**efficient** enough such that you spend more time analyzing your plots than coding and running experiments_

Of course, that's an ideal goal ... but nothing prevents to aim at the sky when reaching the top of the mountain ðŸš¡

Recommended approach is to **fork this repository**, create a new branch in your fork, and open a **pull request** when ready.
This will automatically trigger the CI pipeline that :

1. check linting with `flake8`
2. run all the tests defined in the `tests` folder, and upload a coverage report to `codecov`
3. test all the notebook tutorials

Current coverage is at 100%, so no untested line will be accepted ðŸ˜‡.

> ðŸ“£ Know that no fascist code styling formatter (like `black`, or else ...) will ever be used, as long as I'm still breathing !
