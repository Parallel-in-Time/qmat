# Contributing

ðŸ“œ _Package is currently developed with an open-source philosophy, so any relevant contribution is welcome_

## General rules

Ideally, your code implementation should be :

- _**simple** enough so your grandma can understand it_
- _**beautiful** enough to make your cousin in art school want to read it_
- _**efficient** enough such that you spend more time analyzing your plots than coding and running experiments_

Of course, that's an ideal goal ... but nothing prevents to aim at the sky when reaching the top of the mountain ðŸš¡

Recommended approach is to **fork this repository**, create a new branch in your fork named with the reason of your PR
(don't use `main` !), and open a **pull request** when ready.
This will automatically trigger the CI pipeline that :

1. check linting with `flake8`
2. run all the tests defined in the [`tests` folder](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/qmat/tree/main/tests), and upload a coverage report to [`codecov`](https://app.codecov.io/gh/Parallel-in-Time/qmat)
3. test all the tutorials located in the [`docs/notebook` folder](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/qmat/tree/main/docs/notebooks)

Current coverage is at 100%, so no untested line will be accepted ðŸ˜‡.

> ðŸ“£ Know that no code styling formatter (like `black`, or else ...) will ever be imposed in CI, as long as I'm still breathing !

Chosen merge strategy is to squash commits $\Rightarrow$ you don't have to care about the number of commit included in your PR, so don't be scare of making mistakes before your PR is accepted ðŸ˜‰

> ðŸ”” Once your PR is accepted, please delete this branch from your fork and synchronize your `main` branch. When creating a new development branch later, ensure that you start from an up-to-date `main` branch of your fork. 

In case you are interested in contributing but don't have any idea on what, checkout out [current development roadmap ðŸŽ¯](./devdoc/roadmap.md) and the current [project proposals ðŸŽ“](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/qmat/discussions/categories/project-proposals)
