# Update this documentation

ðŸ“œ _If you think it can be clearer, or you want to add more details or tutorials ..._

## Generating local docs

First you need a few dependencies (besides those for `qmat`). For that download
the [source code](https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/qmat) and install the package with all the 
`docs` dependencies locally :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Parallel-in-Time/qmat.git
cd qmat
pip install -e .[docs]
```

> ðŸ“œ The `-e` option ensures that your installed python package is directly linked to the sources (no copy of code),
> hence modifying any part of the source code (in particular the documentation) 
> will be taken into account when `sphinx` will parse the code docstring.

Then to generate the documentation website locally, simply run :

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

This builds the `sphinx` documentation automatically in a `_build` folder, 
and you can view it by opening `docs/_build/html/index.html` using your favorite browser.

## Updating a tutorial

When changing a [notebook tutorial](../notebooks), you should also regenerate it entirely, in particular if you modified parts of the code.
You can do that by running :

```bash
cd notebooks
./run.sh $NOTEBOOK_FILE
```

If you modified several notebooks, and as a safety, it is also possible to regenerate all doing :

```bash
./run.sh --all
```

> ðŸ“£ When modifying only the markdown text in the notebook, it is not necessary to regenerate the notebook(s).

## Adding a tutorial

Feel free to add new notebooks in the "Advanced Tutorial" section, for a specific application that is not covered by the current tutorials.
Just name the notebook like this : `2{idx}_{shortName}.ipynb` when `idx` corresponds to its index in category (starts at 1),
and use the `Tuto A{idx}` prefix for the notebook title. 

> ðŸ’¡ Don't hesitate to look at the other notebooks to use a common and consistent formatting ...
